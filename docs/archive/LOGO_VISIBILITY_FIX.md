# Logo Visibility and User Profile Image Fix

## 🎨 Logo Visibility Improvements

### Problem
- SVG logo had poor visibility in both dark and light modes
- Logo appeared too plain without proper contrast

### Solution
Applied consistent styling across all logo instances:

1. **Background Container**: Added white/gray background with rounded corners
2. **Shadow**: Added subtle shadow for depth
3. **Filter Effects**: Applied brightness and contrast adjustments
4. **Padding**: Added internal padding for better spacing

### Updated Components

#### ChatMessage.tsx
```jsx
<div className="flex-shrink-0 w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 shadow-md border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
  <div className="w-6 h-6 rounded bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-purple-50 dark:from-gray-700 dark:to-gray-600 p-0.5 flex items-center justify-center">
    <Image
      src="/images/logo.svg"
      alt="AI Assistant"
      width={20}
      height={20}
      className="w-full h-full object-contain"
      style={{
        filter: 'brightness(0.8) contrast(1.2)',
        mixBlendMode: 'multiply'
      }}
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

#### UnifiedAIInterface.tsx
- Applied similar styling to 3 logo instances (chat history, header, typing indicator)
- Consistent background colors for dark/light mode visibility
- Removed `dark:invert` class in favor of better background contrast

## 👤 User Profile Image Fix

### Problem
- User profile picture from sidebar wasn't showing in chat messages
- Email auth users didn't have picture field in their data

### Solution

#### 1. Fixed `verifyToken` in supabase-auth.ts
```typescript
// Added 'picture' to the select query
.select('id, email, name, auth_type, created_at, picture')
```

#### 2. Data Flow
- Dashboard page fetches user info from `/api/auth/status`
- Passes `userInfo` (with picture) to `AIOverlayDashboard`
- `AIOverlayDashboard` passes `userPicture={userInfo?.picture}` to:
  - `ChatMessage` component
  - `UnifiedAIInterface` component

#### 3. Display Logic
```jsx
{userPicture ? (
  <Image
    src={userPicture}
    alt="User"
    width={32}
    height={32}
    className="w-8 h-8 rounded-full object-cover"
  />
) : (
  <User className="w-5 h-5 text-white" />
)}
```

## 🔍 Debug Logs Added
- Added console log in ChatMessage to verify userPicture is received
- Can be removed after testing

## ✅ Visual Improvements
1. **Logo Visibility**:
   - Light mode: White background with subtle shadow
   - Dark mode: Gray background with border
   - Filter effects for better contrast

2. **User Avatar**:
   - Shows actual profile picture when available
   - Falls back to User icon for email auth users without pictures

## 📝 Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test logo visibility in light mode
- [ ] Test logo visibility in dark mode
- [ ] Verify Google OAuth users see their profile picture
- [ ] Verify email auth users see default icon (unless they have uploaded picture)
- [ ] Check responsive sizing on different screens

## 🐛 Known Issues
- Email auth users need a way to upload profile pictures (future feature)
- Logo SVG file might benefit from optimization for better rendering
