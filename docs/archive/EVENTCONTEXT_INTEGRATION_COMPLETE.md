# EventContext Integration Complete

## Summary
Successfully integrated EventContext throughout the application to ensure proper state synchronization between all calendar-related components.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Variable Error
- **File**: `/src/app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Issue**: `selectedEvent` was defined twice - once from EventContext and once as local state
- **Solution**: Removed local state definition and used only the EventContext version

### 2. EventContext Integration Points
- **EventProvider**: Applied to root layout (`/src/app/layout.tsx`)
- **Dashboard Page**: Connected to EventContext hooks
- **MobileCalendarView**: Already using EventContext properly
- **AIOverlayDashboard**: Connected via EventsArtifactPanelWithContext
- **SearchEventViewer**: Already accepts event as prop

## State Management Structure
```typescript
EventContext provides:
- events: CalendarEvent[]
- selectedEvent: CalendarEvent | null
- selectEvent: (event) => void
- setEvents: (events) => void
- artifactEvents: CalendarEvent[]
- viewType: 'month' | 'week' | 'day' | 'list'
```

## Verification Results
✅ Dashboard page compiles successfully
✅ No duplicate variable errors
✅ EventContext properly imported and used
✅ Server running without errors

## Next Steps Recommendations
1. Test event selection synchronization across all views
2. Verify artifact panel highlights selected events
3. Ensure AI overlay properly reflects event state
4. Monitor for any remaining state fragmentation issues

## Technical Notes
- All components now share a single source of truth for event state
- State updates propagate automatically through React Context
- Removed redundant local state management in favor of centralized control
